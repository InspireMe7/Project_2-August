        <!-- <p>Choose your World</p>
        <p>Seasons and temperature

            Temperatures are modeled both outdoors and indoors. As the seasons turn, the outdoor temperatures will rise and fall. Plants only grow in some temperatures. When it gets cold, it will snow. People can get hypothermia or heatstroke.

            You can control indoor temperatures with heaters and air conditioners to aid survival and comfort, or prevent food from rotting. You can even build deadly temperature traps to cook enemies alive.

            World generation and biomes
            The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle.

            Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. The challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.

            You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and more, as well as exotic alien-like lifeforms.</p>

            <p>
                Your Job as a player is to ensure the Survival and thriving of your Colony. You do this by setting Rules for your Colonists behaviour, such as Food Restrictions, defining the Spaces they are allowed to move in, deciding which Clothes and Weapons they equip, what Medicine they can use, when they Sleep and when they work and many others.
                You also place they Layout for the Base which then is build by your Colonists. It is more of a passive Role that the Player has, and the only way to get full Control of the Pawns in the Colony is by drafting them in a fight. Other then that the only influence you have is to tell them what to do.

                <p>
                    Setting up a Colony in rim World can take 30 seconds, or up to 2 hours, Depending on how much control you want to have on the Settings. Especially Mod Managing can take quite some time if you want to avoid Mod conflicts. But for the Start, it should not take longer then 30 minutes.
